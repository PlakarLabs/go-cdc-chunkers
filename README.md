## Overview
`go-cdc-chunkers` is a Golang package designed to provide unified access to multiple Content-Defined Chunking (CDC) algorithms.
With a simple and intuitive interface, users can effortlessly chunk data using their preferred CDC algorithm.

## Use-cases
Content-Defined Chunking (CDC) algorithms are used in data deduplication and backup systems to break up data into smaller chunks based on their content, rather than their size or location. This allows for more efficient storage and transfer of data, as identical chunks can be stored or transferred only once. CDC algorithms are useful because they can identify and isolate changes in data, making it easier to track and manage changes over time. Additionally, CDC algorithms can be optimized for performance, allowing for faster and more efficient processing of large amounts of data.


## Features
- Unified interface for multiple CDC algorithms.
- Supported algorithms: fastcdc, ultracdc, jc (each with a spec-faithful versioned variant).
- Efficient and optimized for performance.
- Comprehensive error handling.
- Supports KFastCDC, a Keyed variant of FastCDC for key-derived Gear

## Installation
```sh
go get github.com/PlakarKorp/go-cdc-chunkers
```


## Usage
Here's a basic example of how to use the package:

```go
    chunker, err := chunkers.NewChunker("fastcdc", rd)   // or ultracdc
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    offset := 0
    for {
        chunk, err := chunker.Next()
        if err != nil && err != io.EOF {
            log.Fatal(err)
        }

        chunkLen := len(chunk)
        fmt.Println(offset, chunkLen)

        if err == io.EOF {
            // no more chunks to read
            break
        }
        offset += chunkLen
    }
```

## Benchmarks
Performance is a key feature in CDC. `go-cdc-chunkers` aims to balance usability,
CPU usage and memory usage.

The following compares chunking **1 GiB of random data** at `min=2 KiB`,
`avg=8 KiB`, `max=64 KiB` against other Go CDC implementations. Throughput is
higher-is-better; bytes and allocations per operation are lower-is-better.

goarch: arm64
cpu: Apple M4 Pro

### Memory and concurrency

The `B/op` above is dominated by the per-chunker scan buffer (`2×MaxSize`).
`NewChunker` allocates that buffer for you, which is convenient but means peak
memory grows with the number of chunkers you create. When running many
chunkers concurrently, use `NewChunkerBuffer` with a caller-owned buffer
(`>= MaxSize`) — typically one pooled buffer per worker goroutine — so peak
memory scales with *concurrency* instead of with the number of chunkers:

```go
var pool = sync.Pool{New: func() any { return make([]byte, opts.MaxSize) }}

buf := pool.Get().([]byte)
defer pool.Put(buf)

chunker, err := chunkers.NewChunkerBuffer("fastcdc", rd, opts, buf)
// ... chunker.Next() / .Copy() / .Split() as usual ...
```

To quantify this, we chunked a 38 GB corpus (≈847k files, ≈5M chunks) with a
varying number of concurrent workers, one chunker per file, discarding the
output. Chunk boundaries are identical across all configurations; only the
memory profile differs (Apple M4 Pro):

| Workers | API                       | Peak RSS  | Total allocated | GC runs |
| ------: | ------------------------- | --------: | --------------: | ------: |
|     100 | `NewChunker`              |  ~432 MB  |          108 GB |    ~840 |
|     100 | `NewChunkerBuffer` pooled |   245 MB  |          1.1 GB |      41 |
|    1000 | `NewChunker`              |  ~578 MB  |          108 GB |    ~690 |
|    1000 | `NewChunkerBuffer` pooled |  ~400 MB  |          1.1 GB |      41 |

Pooling a buffer per worker cuts peak RSS by roughly a third and total
allocations by ~100×, which also reduces GC pressure (and, as a side effect,
slightly improves throughput). The win grows with `MaxSize`: each live
`NewChunker` holds `2×MaxSize`, so a larger maximum chunk size makes the pooled
API proportionally more valuable.

## Tooling

Two command-line tools help decide whether a chunker (or a change to one) is
better, equivalent, or a regression.

`cmd/cdc` is dependency-free (it imports only this library) and prints numbers:

```sh
go run ./cmd/cdc analyze -chunker jc-v1.1.0 FILE...            # dedup ratio, size distribution, MB/s
go run ./cmd/cdc compare -a fastcdc-v1.0.0 -b jc-v1.1.0 FILE...  # side-by-side; non-zero exit on dedup regression
go run ./cmd/cdc resync  -a fastcdc-v1.0.0 -b jc-v1.1.0 FILE     # shared-chunk %% after small edits
```

`resync` is the important one for quality: it applies small insertions to a file
and measures how much of the edited file is still carried by chunks identical to
the original — the content-defined property deduplication actually relies on.

`cmd/cdcplot` renders those measurements as PNG graphs, one set per
implementation (`out/<algo>/`): chunk-size distribution, chunk-size CDF, resync
quality vs number of edits, and dedup ratio vs average chunk size. It lives in
its own module so its plotting dependency is never pulled into this library:

```sh
cd cmd/cdcplot && go run . -kind all -out /tmp/graphs -chunkers fastcdc-v1.0.0,jc-v1.1.0,ultracdc-v1.0.0 FILE...
```

`cmd/cdcbench` measures the time, CPU and memory cost of chunking a whole
directory tree with many concurrent chunkers (one per file). It has two output
styles from a single run: a statistics summary (`-format text`, or `json`/`csv`
for the end-of-run numbers plus a per-sample time series), and PNG graphs of
memory and CPU usage over time. Like `cdcplot` it lives in its own module so the
plotting dependency stays out of the library:

```sh
# statistics
cd cmd/cdcbench && go run . run -root DIR -concurrency 100                 # text summary
cd cmd/cdcbench && go run . run -root DIR -concurrency 100 -pooled         # NewChunkerBuffer path
cd cmd/cdcbench && go run . run -root DIR -concurrency 100 -format csv     # time series, for plotting

# graphs (render directly, or from saved JSON series)
cd cmd/cdcbench && go run . run  -root DIR -concurrency 100 -plot /tmp/g
cd cmd/cdcbench && go run . plot -in a.json,b.json -labels "A,B" -out /tmp/g
```

The graphs below compare the three code paths over a 38 GB / ~847k-file tree at
100 concurrent workers — `v1.0.3` and `main` using `NewChunker`, and `main`
using a pooled `NewChunkerBuffer`. The pooled path holds memory roughly flat
while the default paths climb with the number of live chunkers; CPU cost is the
same across all three (pooling saves memory, not compute).

### Visualizing chunker behaviour

The graphs below are produced by `cmd/cdcplot` over a sample input, one set per
implementation. The resync graph is the one to watch for quality: FastCDC and
JC keep most of the file shared after edits, whereas UltraCDC re-synchronises
less well on this input.
